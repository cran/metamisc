Description: Facilitate meta-analysis of diagnosis and prognosis research studies. It includes functions to  summarize multiple estimates of prediction model discrimination and calibration performance, as described by Debray et al. (2019) <doi:10.1177/0962280218785504>. It also includes functions to evaluate funnel plot asymmetry, as described by Debray et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1266>. Finally, the package provides functions for developing multivariable prediction models from datasets with clustering.
