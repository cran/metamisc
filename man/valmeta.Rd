\description{
This function provides summary estimates for the concordance statistic, the total observed-expected ratio 
or the calibration slope. Where appropriate, data transformations are applied and missing information 
is derived from available quantities. Unless specified otherwise, all meta-analysis models assume random effects 
and are fitted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation with the \pkg{metafor} package (Viechtbauer 2010).  
Further, confidence intervals for the average performance are based on the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method. 
When conducting a Bayesian meta-analysis, the R packages \pkg{runjags} and \pkg{rjags} must be installed.

\details{
\subsection{Meta-analysis of the concordance statistic}{
A summary estimate for the concorcance (c-) statistic can be obtained by specifying \code{measure="cstat"}.
The c-statistic is a measure of discrimination, and indicates the ability of a prediction model to 
distinguish between patients developing and not developing the outcome. The c-statistic typically ranges 
from 0.5 (no discriminative ability) to 1 (perfect discriminative ability). When missing, the c-statistic 
and/or its standard error are derived from other reported information. 
See \code{\link{ccalc}} for more information.

By default, it is assumed that the logit of the c-statistic is Normally distributed within and across studies
(\code{pars$model.cstat = "normal/logit"}). Alternatively, it is possible to assume that the raw c-statistic 
is Normally distributed across studies \code{pars$model.cstat = "normal/identity"}. 
} 

\subsection{Meta-analysis of the total observed versus expected ratio}{
A summary estimate for the total observed versus expected (O:E) ratio can be obtained by specifying
\code{measure="OE"}. The total O:E ratio provides a rough indication of the overall model calibration (across the 
entire range of predicted risks). When missing, the total O:E ratio and/or its standard error are derived from other 
reported information. See \code{\link{oecalc}} for more information.

For frequentist meta-analysis, within-study variation can either be modeled using a Normal (\code{model.oe = "normal/log"} 
or \code{model.oe = "normal/identity"}) or a Poisson distribution (\code{model.oe = "normal/log"}). 

When performing a Bayesian meta-analysis, all data are modeled using a one-stage random effects (hierarchical related regression) model.
In particular, a binomial distribution (if \code{O}, \code{E} and \code{N} is known), a Poisson distribution 
(if only \code{O} and \code{E} are known) or a Normal distribution (if \code{OE} and \code{OE.se} or \code{OE.95CI} are known) is selected separately for each study.

}

\subsection{Bayesian meta-analysis}{
All Bayesian meta-analysis models assume random effects by default. Results are based on the posterior median. 
Credibility and prediction intervals are directly obtained from the corresponding posterior quantiles.

The prior distribution for the (transformed) summary estimate is always modeled using a Normal distribution, 
with mean \code{hp.mu.mean} (defaults to 0) and variance 
\code{hp.mu.var} (defaults to 1E6). For meta-analysis of the total O:E ratio, the maximum value for \code{hp.mu.var} is 100.

By default, the prior distribution for the between-study standard deviation is modeled using a uniform distribution 
(\code{hp.tau.dist="dunif"}), with boundaries \code{hp.tau.min} and \code{hp.tau.max}. Alternatively, it is possible
to specify a truncated Student-t distribution (\code{hp.tau.dist="dhalft"}) with a mean of \code{hp.tau.mean}, 
a standard deviation of \code{hp.tau.sigma} and \code{hp.tau.df} degrees of freedom. This distribution is again 
restricted to the range \code{hp.tau.min} to \code{hp.tau.max}.
}
}
\note{
The width of calculated confidence, credibility and prediction intervals can be specified 
using \code{level} in the \code{pars} argument (defaults to 0.95).
